                <h4>• Drawing • Painting •</h4>
                <p>For as long as I can remember, I've always loved painting. I also enjoyed watching animations and drawing characters that inspired me. I never really thought of it as anything more than a hobby. Sometimes, years would go by without me even picking up a pen or a brush. Then there were and are times I simply can't put it down and I paint and paint!</p>

                <h4>• Editing Videos •</h4>
                <p>I have always dabbled in editing. In no way am I a professional, but I did have an internship when I was a student in Prague to create video tutorials of a certain App. I had to record my screen, edit and clip the videos, add sounds and sound effects, and create a cohesive modern video tutorial. I had so much fun! That's where I learned to work in DaVinci Resolve.</p>

            <div class = "grid-item crochet montserrat">
                <h4>• Crochet •</h4>
                <p>One day, when I was utterly stressed about my final exams, thesis and ending a chapter of my life (graduating from the university), I decided that it was a good idea to learn knitting to soothe my nerves. Knitting was a disaster, I could not get hold of those two stick! But after looking through some tutorials, I found out that there was a thing called "crochet". That's how I started crocheting fluffy toy animals and I really loved it. My first even project looked really bad, you would not even guess what it was. But the second... The second project was a blue sweet dinosaur, and it looked so professional that everyone thought I had bought it. And ever since, I've been crocheting from time to time. I've crocheted so many different animals, then I moved onto tops (cause it was easy), then daisy bags, then blankets, and finally a baby blanket for my friends' kids that is my best work so far. </p>

            <div class = "grid-item reading montserrat">
                <h4>• Reading •</h4>
                <p>I guess this is the most basic and common hobby people can have. But in my experience, reading is the only activity that turns off my mind completely. I sink into the world of the book I'm reading and I really, honestly forget that I even exist, that there is life outside of the book. It's the best feeling sometimes. And to know that you have an escape is so exciting and soothing sometimes. You know?</p>

            <div class = "grid-item pottery montserrat">
                <h4>• Lately, pottery •</h4>
                <p>Lately I've been really into pottery. It's really nice to be involved in it fully, you literally have both hands messy with real clay so you cannot do anything else during it. Building something from scratch feels amazing! It forces me to slow down and focus on just one thing, which is surprisingly peaceful and a great way to disconnect from all the outside noise. Holding a finished, usable mug or a bowl in your hands that you made is extremely rewarding and satisfying. Pottery teaches to be patient. I can't wait to go back!</p>
